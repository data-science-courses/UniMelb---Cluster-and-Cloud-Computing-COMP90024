14:38:04	 From --- : Just want some clarification, do we use -n for mpiexec and -np for mpirun? and whatâ€™s the difference?
14:39:16	 From Alwyn Pan : They are both used to launch a MPI program
14:40:02	 From Alwyn Pan : mpiexec is a part in the MPI standard, but mpirun isn't
14:40:06	 From Richard Sinnott : It is just the command line syntax - they do the same thing (say how many processors you need)
14:40:59	 From --- : Okay, thank you
14:44:24	 From --- : Maybe I missed this part, but how do we create .sh file on spartan? Do we create one at local and then upload it to spartan, or there are some commands we can use to directly create .sh file on spartan?
14:45:01	 From Richard Sinnott : You can do it on spartan directly using the editor of choice, e.g. vi, vim, nano etc
14:45:03	 From Alwyn Pan : You can use nano, vim
14:45:27	 From --- : thanks
