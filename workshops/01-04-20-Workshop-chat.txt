15:10:29	 From --- : right!!!
15:18:26	 From Farzad Khodadadi : Please set the visibility of your questions to everyone so I can see them and reply while Richard is talking
15:35:03	 From --- : So VM’s would count as SaaS or IaaS?
15:35:18	 From Farzad Khodadadi : VMs run at IaaS level
15:36:02	 From Farzad Khodadadi : but if you have s software/service installed on a VM, then that software is considered to be in SaaS level
15:36:29	 From --- : SO you can have multiple levels of services right, is that what you mean?
15:36:35	 From --- : At once I mean.
15:37:13	 From Farzad Khodadadi : Yes
15:37:23	 From llafayette@unimelb.edu.au : Yes. You can have cloud infrastructure running platforms on a cloud which are running software on a cloud.
15:43:16	 From --- : Are there any technologies to provide security for public clouds or there is no security at all?
15:44:42	 From Alwyn Pan : There are technologies available from the providers that you can use to secure your instances
15:45:06	 From --- : How are privacy laws placed upon, based on the user location or the server location?
15:45:15	 From --- : The team is wanting to use AWS lambda and as deployment lead I am suggesting a dedicated server.
15:45:23	 From Alwyn Pan : But it will not be applied by default if you go down the IaaS path. You have to setup yourself
15:45:28	 From --- : does private cloud means
15:45:39	 From --- : AWS lambda is serverless.
15:45:42	 From --- : using
15:46:04	 From Farzad Khodadadi : private cloud means you hosting your own servers and having a software that manages your physical machines for you
15:46:26	 From --- : Thank you
15:47:05	 From Farzad Khodadadi : @Saket: It can be based on both, depending on the cloud provider and the country that hosts the data centre
15:47:42	 From Alwyn Pan : @Saket, it depends. For GDPR, it doesn't matter where the server is, but when you keep data for a person from EU. The GDPR applies to your service. It is more like case to case based.
15:47:58	 From --- : Thanks
15:49:15	 From Farzad Khodadadi : If you search for cloud compliance and governance, there are a lot of extra resources that you can get information in regards to security, privacy, and compliance
15:52:00	 From --- : Yes I have worked with docker and docker-compose. So is docker hub an artifice repository like nexus?
15:52:20	 From --- : artifact*
15:52:22	 From Farzad Khodadadi : Yes Mayanak, you’re right
15:52:24	 From Alwyn Pan : @Mayank
15:52:25	 From Alwyn Pan : yes
15:53:18	 From Farzad Khodadadi : However, Nexus is a more general artifact repository and can host code artifacts as well
15:59:56	 From llafayette@unimelb.edu.au : Nota bene: OpenStack is huge, but it's hard to determine market share because that's usually calculated on revenue, rather than installation and OpenStack is, well, FOSS. CERN uses OpenStack, FWIW.
16:11:04	 From --- : How much storage will be given for VM for Assignment 2? And how many instances?
16:11:33	 From Farzad Khodadadi : You can create up to 4 instances, 250 GB of volume storage
16:11:47	 From --- : Thank you
16:20:56	 From Richard Sinnott : Note that you can do many of these things, but you won’t be able to attach a volume until you have been put in your project groups!
16:21:26	 From Richard Sinnott : The free project, e.g. pt-36042 is the free one (see no volumes available etc)
16:21:58	 From --- : After logging in we cant open any other project for now right ?
16:22:26	 From Richard Sinnott : Correct - at least not until I deal with adding 350+ students into 80 projects… waaah!!! ;-(
16:22:39	 From --- : damn 
16:22:56	 From --- : Is that done manually?
16:23:22	 From --- : Ideally in a CI/CD pipeline, we separate the testing, staging and deployment environment into different servers. However, for the client project I am working on my team is suggesting to go for AWS lambda which is serverless. Is a pipeline in possible with a serverless infrastructure? Will we lose some control in terms of system monitoring and maintenance? I want to avoid AWS as it will lock us down with AWS and move to a dedicated physical server.
16:23:33	 From Richard Sinnott : Historically we could script it on NeCTAR -but not directly possible for us now. I am working on ways to solve this…
16:23:44	 From Richard Sinnott : (Not your problem!)
16:24:37	 From Alwyn Pan : @Mayank, you can still use CI/CD to interact with Lambda
16:24:51	 From Richard Sinnott : We’ll go thru serverless (Lambda, Function as a Service) in a later lecture. There’s nothing to stop you using CI/CD with serverless
16:28:19	 From --- : How are VMs different from Containers?
16:28:57	 From --- : VMs virtualise the hw while containers virtualise OS
16:28:58	 From Alwyn Pan : We will discuss this in week 6
16:46:35	 From --- : Using vscode ssh extension is also another option for windows (easier and better in my opinion).
16:47:27	 From --- : I have the Create Volume disabled :/ it says Quota exceeded
16:47:38	 From --- : me too
16:47:51	 From Richard Sinnott : @Isaac - you can only do this once you’ve been added to your projects
16:48:00	 From Alwyn Pan : Windows 10 now supports SSH out-of-box
16:48:26	 From --- : Oh ok, sounds good
16:48:27	 From Alwyn Pan : @Isaac, your private project will not have volume quota
16:48:28	 From --- : We can also use WSL Ubuntu in windows.
16:48:31	 From --- : yes ssh can be done from cmd
16:48:32	 From Richard Sinnott : Any questions -= then just add them here
16:51:30	 From --- : Does nectar have associated container registry?
16:52:57	 From Richard Sinnott : You can launch docker and it has some support for kubernetes, but there is not an official widely supported docker registry for example on NeCTAR. There are other places to find such things, e.g. docker hub
16:53:06	 From Alwyn Pan : No @Sri
16:53:38	 From --- : Alright, Thanks :)
17:00:18	 From Richard Sinnott : We’ll add these proxy settings onto the LMS so folk can apply them
17:05:50	 From Richard Sinnott : the details of these attaching and formatting volumes are in the slides
17:09:13	 From --- : That was very well explained and informative thanks Farzad!
17:09:31	 From Farzad Khodadadi : You’re welcome. Glad that you found it useful
17:09:51	 From --- : can I tried to login but it did not allow me access will try later
17:10:10	 From Richard Sinnott : Use your unimelb username/password
17:10:13	 From --- : What tools do we need to learn in order to do the assignment 2?
17:10:39	 From --- : used that only
